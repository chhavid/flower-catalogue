        <strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</strong> is a monotypic genus of flowering plants
        in the olive
        family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species, <strong>Abeliophyllum distichum</strong> Nakai, endemic to Korea,
        where it is
        endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white,
        not yellow, flowers. <br> <br>
        It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5
        cm
        wide, pubescent both above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new leaves appear;
        they
        are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3
        cm
        diameter. <br> <br>
        It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
